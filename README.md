## Semver Guidance

> This is a WIP

### Major (X.0.0) - New Sea Discovery

A major version bump represents entering a completely new universe that fundamentally expands what you can do or how you work. This can be a new **technology stack**, a new **domain/discipline**, or a new **level of impact and responsibility**.

**Key Criteria (any ONE of these qualifies):**

**Technology Stack:**
- You can build functional applications with this technology
- You understand the core concepts and can troubleshoot common issues
- You've moved beyond "hello world" into practical implementation

**Domain/Discipline:**
- You've mastered a new area that fundamentally changes how you work
- You can apply this discipline professionally and independently
- It opens entirely new problem-solving capabilities

**Impact/Responsibility:**
- You've achieved a new level of influence or leadership
- You can now shape technical direction, mentor others, or lead initiatives
- Your scope of impact has significantly expanded

**One Piece Example:** *"I've discovered a new sea with its own unique islands and challenges!"*

**Real Examples:**
- **Tech Stack**: Learning React to build complete SPAs, mastering Python for data analysis
- **Domain**: Becoming proficient in testing as a craft, security practices, DevOps workflows
- **Impact**: Moving from IC to leading projects and mentoring, adopting AI-assisted development paradigm
- **Paradigm Shift**: Learning functional programming after OOP, switching to AI-powered workflows

### Minor (0.X.0) - New Island Discovery

Minor bumps represent discovering new capabilities within technologies you already know. These are significant skill expansions that open new possibilities in your current sea.

**Key Criteria:**
- You're building on existing knowledge in a known technology
- You're learning advanced features or new approaches
- The skill significantly expands your capabilities in that area
- You can now solve problems you couldn't before

**One Piece Example:** *"I've found a new island within the Grand Line with unique resources and challenges!"*

**Real Examples:**
- Learning React Hooks after already knowing class components
- Mastering async/await in JavaScript after knowing Promises
- Learning TypeScript after being proficient in JavaScript
- Understanding database optimization after basic SQL knowledge

### Patch (0.0.X) - Hidden Treasure Discovery

Patch versions represent discovering helpful features, tips, or optimizations within skills you already possess. These are small but valuable improvements to your existing toolkit.

**Key Criteria:**
- You're learning about features within known technologies
- The knowledge improves efficiency or code quality
- It's a refinement rather than a new capability
- You're discovering "hidden gems" in familiar tools

**One Piece Example:** *"I found a hidden treasure map on this island that leads to shortcuts and secret passages!"*

**Real Examples:**
- Learning CSS Grid after already knowing Flexbox
- Discovering useful VS Code extensions
- Learning Git shortcuts and aliases
- Finding helpful npm packages for common tasks
- Learning keyboard shortcuts for your IDE
